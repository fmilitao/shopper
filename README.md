# Shopper - Progressive Web App

The intention is for this project to be a re-imagining of `shopper-android` using a progressive web app. This should enable easier updates, since the app should be small anyway, and hopefully simpler to build.

Goals:
 - [ ] Synchronize to Google Sheets
 - [ ] Save to local storage, so synchronization does not need to happen immediately
 - [ ] Simple list filtering to filter by store, category, or something else
 - [ ] Add price when marking as done, estimate the final cost of the list
 - [ ] Price tracking
 - [ ] Make project public when MVP-ready

This needs an API key or permission that I still need to figure out how to store.
